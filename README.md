This is a MySQL Database called Bamazon, the movies-music-broadway edition. View demo here https://youtu.be/JAH1qjKjVMo

## Instructions
A customer will see a table database of ten products with corresponding columns of a unique id for each product, the name of the product, the department name, price (in dollars), and stock quantity.

The user will be prompted by the Node application of the items available for sale and the information above, and with two messages:
1) what is the ID of the product they would like to buy, and
2) how many units of the product they would like to buy.

The customer will place the order with the unique ID which them prompts the application to check if Bamazon store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If yes, the application will process the customer's order. If not, the application will indicate like so, and prevent the order from going through.

The SQL database will be updated to reflect the remaining quantity. The customer will see the total cost of their purchase.
